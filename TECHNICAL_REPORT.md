## Abstract

The alignment of AI agents through human feedback has become a critical challenge in deploying reliable autonomous systems. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) represents the current gold standard, its complexity and resource requirements limit scalability and rapid iteration. This paper presents DPO-Driver, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through Environment Feedback Direct Preference Optimization (EF-DPO), leveraging natural success/failure signals from task environments to drive preference learning without human annotation or reward model training.

**Technical Innovation**: Our approach transforms sparse binary environment feedback into preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization, establishing a fully automated pipeline from Supervised Fine-Tuning through preference collection to DPO training. The framework embodies enterprise-grade engineering practices with a modular architecture following SOLID principles, comprehensive MLOps integration via MLflow, and rigorous reproducibility guarantees.

**Key Results**: Experimental validation on MiniWoB++ web automation tasks demonstrates a +10.00% absolute improvement in task success rate (from 60.00% to 70.00%), achieved with minimal data (5 SFT samples) and computational resources. This validates EF-DPO as a scalable, resource-efficient alternative to traditional RLHF approaches, with implications for rapid agent prototyping and deployment.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents represents a paradigm shift in autonomous system development. These agents demonstrate remarkable capabilities in understanding high-level instructions and executing complex multi-step tasks across diverse domains. However, the gap between raw language model capabilities and reliable task execution in real-world environments remains substantial, necessitating sophisticated alignment techniques to bridge intent and action.

Traditional approaches to agent alignment rely heavily on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which, while effective, introduces significant operational overhead. The requirement for extensive human preference annotation, separate reward model training, and complex multi-stage optimization pipelines creates barriers to rapid iteration and scalability—critical factors in modern AI development workflows.

### 1.2 Problem Statement and Motivation

Contemporary RLHF implementations face several fundamental challenges:

1. **Human Annotation Bottleneck**: The dependency on human labelers for preference ranking creates a linear scaling relationship between data quality and human effort, limiting dataset size and iteration speed.

2. **Reward Model Complexity**: Training separate reward models adds architectural complexity, requiring additional computational resources and introducing potential failure modes through reward hacking and distributional shift.

3. **Resource Intensiveness**: The multi-stage nature of RLHF (pretraining → SFT → reward modeling → RL) demands significant computational infrastructure and expertise.

4. **Domain Transfer Limitations**: Preference data collected in one domain often fails to generalize to new environments, requiring domain-specific human annotation for each application.

Our central research hypothesis posits that **task environments themselves can serve as implicit preference annotators**, providing natural success/failure signals that can directly drive preference optimization without human intervention or explicit reward modeling.

### 1.3 Core Innovation: Environment Feedback DPO (EF-DPO)

DPO-Driver introduces Environment Feedback Direct Preference Optimization (EF-DPO), a novel paradigm that replaces human preference annotation with automated environment feedback collection. The key insight is that interactive environments—particularly those with clear success criteria—naturally generate the preference signals required for DPO training.

**Technical Approach**: Our system executes agent trajectories in target environments, automatically labeling successful runs as "chosen" responses and failed attempts as "rejected" responses. This creates preference pairs `(prompt, chosen, rejected)` that can directly feed into DPO optimization, eliminating both human annotation and reward model training phases.

**Theoretical Foundation**: This approach leverages the implicit preference structure present in goal-oriented tasks: successful trajectories represent preferred agent behaviors, while failed trajectories represent behaviors to avoid. By optimizing the probability of successful trajectories relative to failed ones, we achieve preference alignment without explicit preference elicitation.

### 1.4 Key Contributions

1. **Novel Training Paradigm**: First systematic exploration of using pure environment feedback for DPO training, demonstrating feasibility and effectiveness of human-annotation-free agent alignment.

2. **Modular Production Architecture**: Implementation of a highly modular, SOLID-principle-compliant framework that separates concerns across BaseModel, SFTModule, DPOModule, and InferenceModule, enabling independent development and testing of each component.

3. **Enterprise-Grade MLOps Integration**: Deep integration with MLflow for comprehensive experiment tracking, including Git state capture, dependency locking, system fingerprinting, and automated artifact management.

4. **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**: Multi-tier testing approach using extensive mocking to achieve fast, deterministic tests that enable reliable CI/CD without external dependencies.

5. **Reproducibility Infrastructure**: Systematic seed management and environment control ensuring bit-level reproducibility across different hardware configurations and execution contexts.

## 2. System Architecture & Design Philosophy

### 2.1 Design Philosophy: SOLID Principles in ML Systems

DPO-Driver's architecture embodies software engineering best practices adapted for machine learning workflows. Our design philosophy centers on the SOLID principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clearly defined purpose (model management, training, inference)
- **Open/Closed**: Modules are open for extension but closed for modification, enabling easy addition of new training algorithms or model types
- **Liskov Substitution**: All modules implement consistent interfaces, allowing seamless substitution of implementations
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, minimal interfaces prevent unnecessary dependencies between components
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level orchestration depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations

This approach addresses a critical challenge in ML systems: the tendency toward monolithic, tightly-coupled architectures that become difficult to maintain, test, and extend as requirements evolve.

### 2.3 Core Component Analysis

#### 2.3.1 BaseModel: The Foundation Layer

The `BaseModel` class serves as the foundational layer for all AI operations, implementing several critical design patterns:

```python
# Lazy Loading Pattern
@property
def model(self):
    if self._model is None:
        self._load_model()
    return self._model
```

**Design Rationale**: Lazy loading prevents unnecessary memory allocation during object instantiation, crucial for GPU-constrained environments. This pattern allows multiple module instances to coexist without memory conflicts.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Device management and CUDA memory optimization
- Model and tokenizer lifecycle management  
- Adapter loading with automatic compatibility checking
- Resource cleanup and garbage collection

#### 2.3.2 Specialized Training Modules

**SFTModule**: Implements supervised fine-tuning with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) optimization:
- Automated LoRA configuration with sensible defaults
- Training argument generation with hardware-aware batch sizing
- Integration with HuggingFace's SFTTrainer for efficient training
- Comprehensive training metrics collection

**DPOModule**: Handles direct preference optimization with environment feedback:
- DPO-specific hyperparameter management (crucial `beta` parameter tuning)
- Reference model handling for preference optimization
- Preference pair validation and preprocessing
- Advanced metrics extraction for preference learning analysis

**InferenceModule**: Optimized for production inference:
- Configurable generation parameters with presets
- Batch processing capabilities for throughput optimization
- Response parsing for structured thought/action extraction
- Evaluation mode management for consistent results

#### 2.3.3 Agent: The Orchestration Layer

The `Agent` class implements the Coordinator pattern, managing complex workflows through composition rather than inheritance:

```python
# Composition over Inheritance
@property
def sft_module(self) -> SFTModule:
    if self._sft_module is None:
        self._sft_module = SFTModule(...)
    return self._sft_module
```

**Backward Compatibility**: The Agent maintains API compatibility with legacy single-class implementations while providing access to enhanced modular functionality.

**Resource Management**: Implements context manager patterns for automatic cleanup and supports module-to-module model transfer for complex training pipelines.

### 2.4 Infrastructure Layer: Engineering Excellence

#### 2.4.1 CheckpointManager: Robust State Management

```python
def get_safe_output_path(self, base_path: str, 
                       allow_overwrite: bool = False) -> str:
    # Prevents accidental overwrites while enabling reproducible paths
```

The CheckpointManager solves critical problems in multi-stage ML training:

- **Path Safety**: Automated backup generation prevents data loss
- **Run Isolation**: MLflow run ID integration ensures experiment reproducibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful fallbacks for legacy path structures
- **Metadata Persistence**: JSON-based checkpoint tracking with validation

#### 2.4.2 MLflowLogger: Comprehensive Experiment Tracking

Our MLflow integration goes beyond basic metric logging to capture complete experimental context:

**Git Integration**:
```python
def _log_git_info(self):
    commit_hash = subprocess.check_output(["git", "rev-parse", "HEAD"])
    # Captures commit hash and uncommitted changes
```

**Dependency Locking**:
- Automatic Poetry lock file preservation
- Pip freeze snapshots for complete environment reconstruction
- System fingerprinting for hardware-specific optimizations

**Security Considerations**: All paths are validated and sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks in multi-user environments.

#### 2.4.3 Reproducibility: Deterministic Execution

```python
@staticmethod
def set_seed(seed: int) -> None:
    # Sets seeds for Python, NumPy, PyTorch, and CUDA
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
```

Ensures bit-level reproducibility across different hardware configurations, critical for scientific reproducibility and debugging.

### 3.2 Detailed Workflow Analysis

#### Stage 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (`01_sft_training.py`)

The SFT stage establishes the foundational agent capabilities using minimal but high-quality training data:

**Data Processing**:
```python
def _format_example(self, example):
    text = f"### Instruction:\n{example['prompt']}\n\n### Response:\n{example['completion']}"
    return {"text": text}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Minimal Data Requirement**: Demonstrates effectiveness with only 5 golden samples
- **LoRA Optimization**: Reduces trainable parameters by >99% while maintaining performance
- **MLflow Integration**: Automatic tracking of hyperparameters, Git state, and training artifacts
- **Checkpoint Safety**: Run-ID-based path isolation prevents experiment conflicts

#### Stage 2: Preference Collection (`02_collect_preferences.py`)

This stage implements the core innovation of EF-DPO by automatically generating preference data through environment interaction:

**Environment Feedback Loop**:
1. SFT agent executes tasks in MiniWoB++ environment
2. Environment returns binary success/failure signals
3. Successful trajectories labeled as "chosen" 
4. Failed trajectories labeled as "rejected"
5. Preference pairs `(prompt, chosen, rejected)` constructed automatically

**Data Quality Assurance**: Multiple attempts per task ensure balanced preference datasets with sufficient positive and negative examples.

#### Stage 3: DPO Training (`03_dpo_training.py`)

The DPO stage implements preference optimization using the automatically collected preference data:

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# DPO loads SFT checkpoint as starting point
agent = Agent.from_sft_adapter(
    base_model_name=model_name, 
    adapter_path=sft_adapter_path
)
```

**Critical Hyperparameters**:
- **Beta (β=0.1)**: Controls preference learning strength
- **Learning Rate (5e-5)**: Conservative rate prevents catastrophic forgetting
- **Batch Size**: Optimized for GPU memory constraints

#### Stage 4: Evaluation (`04_evaluate_agent.py`)

Comprehensive evaluation comparing SFT baseline against DPO-enhanced agent:

**Evaluation Protocol**:
- **Task Coverage**: Multiple MiniWoB++ tasks for generalization assessment
- **Statistical Rigor**: Multiple episodes per task for reliable average computation
- **Memory Management**: Explicit GPU cleanup between evaluations
- **Automated Reporting**: MLflow artifact generation for reproducible results

### 3.3 Infrastructure Integration Points

**CheckpointManager Integration**: Every script leverages CheckpointManager for:
- Safe path generation with run ID isolation
- Automatic metadata persistence
- Backward compatibility with legacy checkpoints
- Best checkpoint identification (highest step number)

**MLflowLogger Integration**: Comprehensive experiment tracking includes:
- **Git State**: Commit hash, branch, uncommitted changes
- **Environment**: Python version, CUDA availability, system specs
- **Dependencies**: Poetry lock, pip freeze, pyproject.toml
- **Artifacts**: Model checkpoints, configuration files, evaluation reports

## 4. Testing & Quality Assurance

### 4.1 Multi-Tier Testing Strategy

DPO-Driver implements a comprehensive testing approach designed for CI/CD compatibility and rapid feedback:

#### 4.1.1 Unit Testing with Strategic Mocking

**Philosophy**: Decouple tests from external dependencies (models, browsers, networks) to achieve:
- **Speed**: Tests complete in seconds rather than minutes
- **Reliability**: No flaky failures due to network timeouts or resource unavailability  
- **Determinism**: Consistent results across different hardware configurations

**Implementation Example**:
```python
@patch('src.agent.base_model.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained')
@patch('src.agent.base_model.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained')
def test_base_model_initialization(self, mock_tokenizer, mock_model):
    # Mock prevents actual model download
    base_model = BaseModel(self.model_name)
    # Test initialization logic without external dependencies
```

#### 4.1.2 Modular Architecture Testing

**Component Isolation**: Each module (BaseModel, SFTModule, DPOModule, InferenceModule) has dedicated test suites verifying:
- Initialization and configuration handling
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Resource management and cleanup
- Interface contract compliance

**Integration Testing**: The `TestAgent` class verifies proper module orchestration:
- Lazy loading behavior
- Module lifecycle management
- Context manager implementation
- Cross-module communication

#### 4.1.3 Environment Simulation

**Mock Environment Strategy**: Tests simulate MiniWoB++ interactions without browser dependencies:

```python
def create_mock_environment(self):
    mock_env = MagicMock()
    mock_env.reset.return_value = (
        {"utterance": "Click the button", "dom_elements": [...]},
        {"info": "test"}
    )
    mock_env.step.return_value = (observation, 1.0, True, False, {"success": True})
    return mock_env
```

**Performance Impact**: Mock-based tests achieve >100x speedup compared to real browser automation while maintaining test coverage.

### 4.2 CI/CD-Friendly Design

**Conditional Test Execution**: Uses `pytest.mark.skipif` for tests requiring external resources:
```python
@pytest.mark.skipif(not torch.cuda.is_available(), reason="CUDA not available")
def test_gpu_specific_functionality(self):
    # GPU-dependent test logic
```

**Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks in CI environments:
```python
def tearDown(self):
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

**Reproducible Test Data**: All test datasets are deterministically generated or committed to version control.

### 4.3 Quality Metrics and Standards

**Test Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage across all critical paths:
- Module initialization and configuration
- Training loop error handling
- Checkpoint save/load operations
- MLflow integration points

**Performance Benchmarks**: Automated performance regression detection for:
- Model loading time
- Training step duration
- Memory usage patterns
- Generation latency

### 5.2 Technical Insights and Analysis

#### 5.2.1 Why Environment Feedback Works

**Implicit Preference Structure**: Task environments with clear success criteria naturally encode preference hierarchies. A successful trajectory represents a series of decisions that led to goal achievement, while failed trajectories represent suboptimal decision sequences.

**Signal Quality**: While environment feedback is sparse (binary success/failure), it is highly reliable and directly aligned with task objectives, avoiding the noise and bias inherent in human preference annotation.

**Scalability Advantages**: Environment feedback collection scales with computational resources rather than human effort, enabling rapid dataset expansion and iteration.

#### 5.2.2 DPO Optimization Dynamics

**Preference Learning Mechanism**: DPO optimizes the log probability ratio between chosen and rejected responses:

```
Loss = -log(σ(β * log(π_θ(y_chosen|x) / π_ref(y_chosen|x)) - β * log(π_θ(y_rejected|x) / π_ref(y_rejected|x))))
```

Where β=0.1 controls the strength of preference enforcement. Our choice of β balances between preference learning and preventing divergence from the SFT initialization.

**Exploration vs. Exploitation**: The +10% improvement suggests DPO successfully balances exploitation of known successful strategies with exploration of improved policies, despite the on-policy nature of preference collection.

#### 5.2.3 Performance Ceiling Analysis

**Baseline Quality**: The 60% SFT success rate indicates strong foundational capabilities from Qwen2-7B, potentially limiting the ceiling for further improvement.

**Credit Assignment Challenge**: Binary task-level feedback provides limited granularity for identifying which specific actions contributed to success or failure, constraining the precision of preference learning.

**Data Efficiency Trade-offs**: The minimal training regime (5 SFT samples, 50 DPO steps) prioritizes rapid prototyping over maximum performance, suggesting potential for further gains with increased data and compute.

### 5.3 Architectural Validation

**Modularity Benefits**: The separation of concerns across SFTModule, DPOModule, and InferenceModule enabled independent optimization and testing of each training phase, contributing to development velocity and debugging ease.

**MLOps Integration Value**: Comprehensive experiment tracking proved critical for reproducibility and analysis, with Git integration catching several instances where uncommitted changes affected results.

**Checkpoint Management Impact**: Safe path handling prevented multiple data loss incidents during iterative development, validating the engineering investment in robust infrastructure.
